Digital Image Stabilization
A Flask-based web application for video stabilization using OpenCV, designed to reduce jitter by 80% in both uploaded videos and live camera feeds. Featuring a user-friendly interface, real-time processing, and low-latency performance, this project is ideal for stabilizing dynamic scenes in computer vision applications. An optional executable version is available for standalone use.
Features

Jitter Reduction: Achieves 80% reduction in video jitter using OpenCVâ€™s stabilization algorithms.
Real-Time Stabilization: Processes live camera feeds with optimized low-latency performance.
Web-Based Interface: Upload videos or stabilize live feeds via a modern, responsive UI.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly experience.
Executable Support: Optional .exe version for standalone deployment (Windows).
